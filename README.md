### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emily Mahoney. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a part-time analyst at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center and a full-time student. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python among many other things! 
- ðŸ”¨ R and shell are the programming languages in which I am most proficient. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Almost nothing makes me happier than coffee and either programming or philosophy in the morning.
